data cleaning project with shark attack info

The goal with this project is to create a data frame from a csv file of shark attack reports and produce visualizations of various relationships within the data and help us pull out some interesting or useful conclusions.

The first step of this is to convert the csv file into a panda dataframe. Then we must clean the column names and select relevant columns that contain interesting information. Then next step is to eleminate rows that don't contain sufficient information. 

Now, we must clean up the infomation contained within the dataframe. First, we have converted all NaN values to "n/a" so we can handle those entries. The most involved step of this process is converting the many irregular entries into actionable data.

Once we have cleaned up the entries we are able to isolate and accurately visualize certain aspects of the data and provide some insights into the nature of shark attacks.
